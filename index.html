			Max von Hippel is the first author on the paper 
			<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-54549-9_9" style="color:red">Automated Attacker Synthesis for Distributed Protocols</a>, 
			submitted to fulfill the paper requirement. Max led the work in collaboration with his advisors at the time: Stavros Tripakis, who provided guidance in the formal methods field, and Cristina Nita-Rotaru, who provided guidance regarding attacks against network protocols. An undergraduate student named Cole Vick joined the project toward the end of the Fall semester of 2019. The paper takes a formal approach to the automated synthesis of attackers, i.e. adversarial processes that can cause the protocol to malfunction. Given a formal threat model capturing the distributed protocol model and network topology, as well as the placement, goals, and interface (inputs and outputs) of potential attackers, the paper shows how to  automatically synthesize an attacker. Max led all aspects of this paper including formalizing ideas and solutions, implementing a case study based on TCP, and writing the paper itself. It is quite uncommon for a PhD student to submit a paper during his first year, but Max managed to do so, and his paper was accepted in SafeComp 2020 where Max gave the presentation. Additionally, he was invited to present this work at several other seminars: at the University of Arizona Mathematics Department, the CSAIL Security Seminar at MIT, and the CSE/ECE Security Seminar at UConn.
